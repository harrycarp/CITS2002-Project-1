# OVERVIEW

```bash
Successful completion of the project will develop your understanding of some advanced 
features of the C99 programming language, and your understanding of how an 
operating system can manage processes and inter-process communication.
```

## Description
UNIX-based operating systems employ pre-emptive process scheduling policies to execute hundreds of processes 
'simultaneously' on a single CPU. Process take turns to execute on the CPU until they explictly exit, perform an 
operation that would block (stall) their execution, or until their rationed time on the CPU has elapsed. Only a single
 process may be 'on' the CPU at one time, and this process is uniquely marked as bing in the Running state.
All processes are uniquely identified by a positive integer value termed a process-identifier, or PID. When a 
UNIX-based operating system has finished booting, only a single process exists (with PID=1) and is executing on the CPU. 
Like all (future) processes, this initial process may use the CPU to perform some computation or request actions of the 
operating system kernel by making system-calls.

The processes simulated in this project may only perform a limited number of system-calls, and may only make their 
system-calls when executing on the CPU. These are described here, along with reference to the possible execution states 
of the processes.

A process may execute on the CPU for a requested number of microseconds by calling the compute() system-call. 
The process does not occupy (does not own) the CPU for the requested time, uninterrupted. Instead, its use of the CPU 
is interleaved with other processes in a pre-emptive manner. For example, consider a computer system with a 
scheduling-quantum of 1000 microseconds. If a process requests to compute (on the CPU) for 3200 microseconds, 
it will first occupy the CPU for 1000 microseconds, leave the CPU, be marked as Ready while other process(es) execute, 
occupy the CPU for another 1000 microseconds, and so on..., until its final turn on the CPU 
(for the remaining 200 microseconds). It will then be marked as Ready, ready to make its next system-call 
when it next runs on the CPU.

A process may relinquish its use of the CPU by calling the sleep() system-call, indicating for how many microseconds 
it wishes to sleep. The process will leave the CPU, be marked as Sleeping, and will not execute again until at least 
that time has passed.

A process may request its own termination by calling the exit() system-call. When a process terminates, its resources 
(if any?) are deallocated, any pipes that it had opened for reading or writing are closed (see later), and its PID may 
be re-used (re-assigned) for future processes.

A process may request to be informed of the termination of another process by calling the wait() system-call. Until the 
process being waited for terminates the calling process will be marked as Waiting. When the process being waited for 
eventually terminates, the calling process is marked as Ready.

A process may create a new process by calling the fork() system-call. The process making the fork() system-call is 
termed the parent process, and the newly created process is termed the child process. The new child process is 
initialised with a copy of all attributes of the parent process, except that its cumulative execution time is set to 
zero, and it receives the next available (unused) PID.

A process may request a new inter-process communication buffer termed a pipe(). A pipe is a unidirectional in-memory 
array of bytes (of finite size). Pipes connect two processes - one process may write data to the pipe, and the other may 
read data from it. Each process has a limited number of pipe-descriptors - non-negative integers which refer to either 
the 'writing end' or the 'reading end' of a pipe. When a process creates a new pipe by calling the pipe() system-call, 
the creating process immediately becomes the writer of the pipe. When a process forks a new (child) process, the new 
child process immediately becomes the reader of the pipe. When a pipe has both a writer and a reader, the two processes 
may communicate by writing to and reading from the pipe.

A process may write or read data to a pipe using the writepipe() or readpipe() system-calls. Pipes may hold a fixed 
amount of data (typically 4KB).

A process attempting to write more data than will fit in the pipe will write some (possibly none) of its data to the 
pipe, and then block until some space becomes available in the pipe. A writing process will remain blocked until all of 
its writepipe() request has been written to the pipe after which it will be marked as Ready again.

A process attempting to read from an empty pipe will block until some bytes are available in the pipe. A reading process
 will remain blocked until all of its readpipe() request has been read from the pipe after which it will be marked as 
 Ready again.

Note: the implementation and operation of pipes required for this project is slightly different, and much simpler, than 
'true' pipes in a UNIX-based operating system.

## Event Files
An eventfile is a simple text file containing the historic record of the system-calls requested by the processes of a 
simple computer system. After the computer system has booted, only a single process (with PID=1) will be running. Thus 
the first line of every eventfile is a system-call request by PID=1, and no other processes will appear until that first
process performs a fork(). The very last line of an eventfile will record the last exit() call, after which no 
processes will be running (and the system halts). Each line of the file consists of a number of white-space separated 
words. The first word is always a positive PID, indicating which process is performing the action described on the 
remainder of the line. The second word on each line is always the name of a system-call requested by the process. 
Some lines will also have one or two additional words which further describe input paramete(s) for the system-call, 
or the value returned by the system-call. The supported system-calls are:

compute() microseconds-required-on-CPU

sleep() microseconds-to-sleep

exit()

wait() PID-to-wait-for

fork() PID-of-new-child-process

pipe() new-writing-pipe-descriptor

writepipe() writing-pipe-descriptor number-of-bytes

readpipe() reading-pipe-descriptor number-of-bytes

You will be provided will starting code to parse the information in the eventfiles. 
You will then need to store this information in your own data-structures and variables 
before you can commence the simulation. Your may assume that the format of each eventfile is correct, 
and its data consistent, so you do not need to check for any errors in the eventfile.


## Project Requirements

---TBA---

## Assessment

This project is INDIVIDUAL work.
The project deadline is 5PM Fri 11th September (end of week 7), and is worth 30% of your final mark for CITS2002.
The project will be marked out of 40. 20 of the possible 40 marks will come from the correctness of your solution. 
The remaining 20 marks will come from your programming style, including your use of meaningful comments, well chosen 
identifier names, appropriate choice of basic data-structures and data-types, and appropriate choice of control-flow 
constructs.

During the marking, attention will obviously be given to the correctness of your solution. However, a correct and 
efficient solution should not be considered as the perfect, nor necessarily desirable, form of solution. Preference 
will be given to well presented, well documented solutions that use the appropriate features of the language to 
complete tasks in an easy to understand and easy to follow manner. That is, do not expect to receive full marks for 
your project simply because it works correctly. Remember, a computer program should not only convey a message to the 
computer, but also to other human programmers.

Your project will be marked on a computer running a standard version of Linux. No allowance will be made for a program 
that "works at home" but not on a Linux computer, so be sure that your code compiles and executes correctly on a Linux 
system before you submit it.

## Submission Requirements

The deadline for the project is 5PM Friday 11th September (end of week 7).

Your submission's C99 source file should each begin with the C99 block comment:

/* CITS2002 Project 1 2020
   Name:                student-name
   Student number(s):   student-number
 */

You must submit your project electronically using cssubmit. You should submit a single C99 source-code file, 
named pipesim.c. You do not need to submit any additional testing scripts or files that you used while developing 
your project. The cssubmit facility will give you a receipt of your submission. You should print and retain this 
receipt in case of any dispute. Note also that the cssubmit facility does not archive submissions and will simply 
overwrite any previous submission with your latest submission.

This project is subject to UWA's Policy on Assessment - particularly ยง10.2 Principles of submission and penalty for 
late submission. In accordance with this policy, you may discuss with other students the general principles required 
to understand this project, but the work you submit must be the result of your own efforts. All projects will be 
compared using software that detects significant similarities between source code files. Students suspected of 
plagiarism will be interviewed and will be required to demonstrate their full understanding of their project submission.
